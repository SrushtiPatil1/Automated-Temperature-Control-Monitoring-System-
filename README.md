# Cold Storage Automation

**Automating Cold Storage Facility For Temperature Monitoring and Control**  

In the field of cold storage facilities, preserving products at the desired temperature is crucial. Manual temperature monitoring is labor-intensive and error-prone, potentially compromising the quality of stored goods.  

This project introduces an **automated cold storage monitoring system** using advanced technologies like the DHT sensor, ESP8266 WiFi module, relay, DC motor, and fan. It enables reliable temperature control, real-time monitoring, alerts, and remote access, improving efficiency and product safety.
