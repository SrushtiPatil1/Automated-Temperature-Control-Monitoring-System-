                Our model comprises of: -<br>

                <strong> Fetched Sensor Data: </strong>DHT stands for Digital Humidity and Temperature. We have used a
                DHT22 Sensor which continuously fetches real time temperature and humidity data and sends it to the
                Nodemcu ESP8266. This data can be viewed on the serial monitor.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Send Data To Cloud Server: </strong>In this module we have used Firebase as a cloud server based
                database. Firebase stores the temperature and humidity data that is provided by the DHT22 sensor. This
                data is stored for display purposes and for analysis purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Automated Cooling:</strong> A threshold temperature value is asked from the end user(industry
                expert) and is saved in the database. When this threshold is reached or when this threshold value is
                crossed, the fan starts cooling. This process is completely automatic and requires no human
                intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>User Interface:</strong> The user can access the data with the help of the website that we have
                created. Once the user logs in our website, he/she can easily get access to the temperature and humidity
                data.He/she can set/update the threshold value as per the requirement.
